## Overview
Using the source code and styling provided by Front End Mentor, I built a QR Code card using ReactBootstrap.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
= [ReactBootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/components/cards)


### What I learned

I learned a lot about using Sass, this is the first project I've used it on and although my code is not perfectly efficient in it's use. I am excited to keep working with Sass.

I also learned the best practice for creating my React shell with the source code provided by Frontend Mentor. This project has a redundant setup. I will be adjusting the file structure and repo conventions on the next challenge so deployment goes easier.
